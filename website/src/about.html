<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  My name is Peter and I'm a software developer with a love for simple and efficient solutions. I'm not dogmatic, but, I do feel that writing code in a functional style often helps me keep my solutions simpler, so do expect a bias towards functional programming here. Regarding efficient solutions, I find simple code easier to optimize, in particular ensure that there's nothing unnecessary going on. So simple and efficient code often goes hand in hand for me. But, I also don't hesitate to ditch lovely things, such as simplicity, immutability, and readability, when warranted and needed.

  Another strong interest of mine is data science. Also for data science, I have a weak heart for efficient and simple models. My thinking goes along the ways: why do classification with a LLM if logistic regression achieves equally good results? Whenever using a more powerful (and power hungry) model, I love to see a great return of investment. Each joule counts!

  This website is my personal space. That is, I primarily write for myself. But I hope you find the content useful. I'll write as I learn, and I'll write as I spot opportunities to teach, to share some of the strange (but useful) models my brain has built up for various concepts over the decades.

  See you around and have a nice day!
